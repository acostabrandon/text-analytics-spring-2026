London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Absolutely disgusted with BA. my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed. BA had one job to do - put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in Stuttgart. This has proven too difficult.

"London to New York JFK with British Airways, and abyssal customer service. Onboard the flight can be great, and it's the website and shoddy call centre staff who let them down. However, this time the onboard service was as bad as the ground service. Food was poor. I was in the upper deck with only 5 other business class passengers, and yet my food choice was gone. The TV's didn't work in 2 seats - I couldn't be bothered to try a third and decided to just get some sleep.

British Airways are not interested in providing normal business class comforts and cuisine or even lounges on some routes. The Cancun route and the Nassau routes I have flown recently show this clearly as they are presumably are not bothered with little or no competition at all. This saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type routes they will provide the absolute minimum on everything. One example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems I encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the Cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as BA only allocated one packet per person. The staff all agree that this was pathetic!

Flew YVR to MUC via LHR. I had high expectations for this airline but was pretty disappointed. We were flying with twin 15 month olds so it's great with BA that you can preselect the bassinet spots when booking. Crew did bare minimum seemed as though asking for anything was a huge inconvenience. Audio on IFE was awful couldn't hear any movies. Flight landed 10 minutes late in London and we were denied boarding on the MUC flight due to being late. If they allow a connection of 1h10 and you're 10 minutes late and can't get on their system is flawed. When are any LHR flights not 10 mins late! They rebooked us 2.5 hours later but after complaining put us on a Lufthansa flight 1 hour later.

A bizarre exchange followed. First they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. I told them to look at the ticket. You can't get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. I contacted BA Germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge.  I booked with BA on their website. They saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund, but then you can't get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance.

"Club class on British Airways between Cape Town and London. Boeing 747-400 has the flat bed and while the quality of the cabin was inferior to the A380 between London and Johannesburg, it remains one of the better business class product. Check in at the BA counters in Cape Town would have been a breeze, was it not for the unexpected six hour delay in the departure of the flight. The upgrade from Premium to Club class made this inconvenience almost bearable. However,  Cape Town airport becomes like a ghost town when all flights but yours have departed. BA's Executive lounge in Cape Town is spacious and serves good food and Cape wines. There are free internet and computers and a friendly service, even at midnight. While comfortable, BA's Club seats on the 747 can do with an upgrade. They are configured in a 2-4-2 layout, with one passenger facing forward and the one adjacent facing backward, at the side row - the middle row has two forward and two backward facing. This is something I never understood - why facing backward because it just makes no sense. The seats are separated by a hard plastic cseparator that moves up and down with the push of a button. Theoretically, the air hostess should walk behind the front-facing seat to serve the backward-facing passenger at the window - however, on my flight the air hostess insisted on leaning over me, pushing the button to lower the separator and serving the accross my seat - after about three times this really got annoying. The problem is that if you don't raise the separator, you and your fellow passengers stare straight at each other from a distance of less than one meter. Food was satisfactory, rather than outstanding. . The starter choices were poached Norwegian Salmon with marinated prawns or an oyster mushroom salad. Main courses included Ballotine of chicken with Port, Drakensberg trout, pasta or a cold main course salad of za'atar beef medallion. I chose the chicken and it was OK, but inferior to my mother's Sunday roast chicken. There was a selection of South African Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and some good reds. Breakfast was a choice of a cheese omelette, continental or a traditional English breakfast with bacon, sausages, mushrooms and potatoes. Arriving in London, I took the supposedly fast track option - a big mistake. In theory this is supposed to expedite your progress through customs as a Club passenger, but in practice it was a disaster - there were only two or three border agents present at any time and it took 45 to 60 minutes to get through the fast track immigration - I could see group after group of fellow BA passengers clearing the slow lane long before I took the next few steps forward. BA arrivals lounge was a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of Heathrow Terminal 5. All in all, not a bad experience, but having flown on these seats quite a few times over the past 15 or more years, I really think it is time to either upgrade the Club cabin on the 747's.",0.058,0.854,0.088,0.9691,positive,0.03900966183574879,0.45555555555555555,neutral,0.02723747305572033,0.827235758304596,0.002077506622299552,0.07932540774345398,0.05826188996434212,0.005861927755177021,joy,positive

"Flying in Club Europe from London City to Berlin Tegel, returning in economy with British Airways. The outbound flight was delayed for nearly 1 hour. However, the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable. The food offered in the CE cabin was delicious. Flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare. Everything went wrong from checking in, lounge access, baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage. I had done my online check in on my return flight. Just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage. The check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later I discovered had been incorrectly issued to me. She checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine. After I dropped off my luggage, I went to the business lounge as I am a silver member. I provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined. Not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass. However, I showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app. She didn't even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system. she didn't investigate anything and asked me to call up BA which I didn't bother. When I was queuing up at the passport control, I noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect. I approached the BA staff at the gate immediately after I had cleared through security. BA staff were shocked that I was checked in under someone else's name. Wrong name, Wrong flight etc. They asked me to go to the correct gate immediately, but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and I might not have it back upon arrival at LCY. They gave me a new luggage tag. After arriving at LCY, waited for 20mins, bag didn't show up. I approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone. I explained the situation which she didn't really pay attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt, insisting my luggage would arrive. Again, no investigation, rushed service and a bit rude. 3 days later - no luggage still despite the fact that they have located my luggage.

"Athens to London with British Airways. To call this business class is some sort of mean spirited joke. To start with British Airways lounge is provided by Skyways which as jammed with both people and a bad assortment of food. The actual seat (3D) had no power plugs and no TV at the front of the seat, what you find in economy in Canada. The seat width was narrow and the pitch was pathetic. Flying premium economy on Cathay Pacific is dramatically superior. The flight from Heathrow to Athens was on a very beat up B767 on Aug 4/ 2017. The food on this flight was both minuscule and horrid.

"Heathrow to Bilbao. Boarding of the flight at Heathrow was very good , the flight was on time and the plane was clean. Frequent flyers boarded first and the rest soon followed. From then on the service was very similar to a Easy Jet or Eurowings flight. The 3 crew member's in economy passed through the cabin selling M&S sandwiches , snacks and coffee. The flight out of Bilbao was delayed by a late incoming aircraft, information on the delay was a little slow in coming from the gate agent. However the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed. The flight crew also managed to shave 15 minutes off the flight time too.

"BA362 6th June 2015. If this were the first flight I had taken with British Airways I would not be impressed. At check in there is a lack of professionalism.

"We have had some torrid experiences with BA - which we have not been shy to report. So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. Cheerful, efficient and calm. What more could you ask? The food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars!

"Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor.

"My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed.

"I flew London to Cairo and return in October 2023. It was basically a perfectly good pair of flights in Economy, with pleasant and professional cabin crew (especially on the return journey). Being only 1.73 m tall I have no problem with legroom in the back of the plane, the seat was OK if getting a little numbing after 5 hours, and the return of a rather good included snack box and drinks was welcome. However, it must be said that the value for money was poor: with a checked bag on the return leg only, this was a nearly £700 ticket.

"London Heathrow - Vancouver - London Heathrow. First impressions could have been better as this flight departs from Terminal 3, rather than terminal 5 at Heathrow. The departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gates. However the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it. Once on board I found the cabin to be very clean. Unlike many airlines, BA offers economy seating upstairs on the A380 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft. However the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual, which could be an issue for those with roller cases. The IFE system provided is excellent. I also ordered one of BA's new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard meal. This option was well worth taking up, offering an improved choice and quality. The service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where British Airways seems to do consistently well. If I have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch seems miserly for a 9-10 hour flight. Arrival at Vancouver was on time and I was through immigration and landside in about 20 minutes. Processing through security for departure from YVR was equally efficient. The return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one, although arrival in London was an hour late. However the relatively quiet cabin on the A380 meant that I was able to get some sleep. Unfortunately the arrival experience at LHR terminal 3 was no better than the departure one. A lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having to join a slow-moving, snaking line to clear immigration.

"Our first time flying to Dominican Republic and found the best deal with British Airways and the benefit was it is a direct flight from Gatwick to Punta Cana. On the outbound flight, the plane was half empty, so it was nice and spacious. The BA Boeing 777 is an outdated plane which has been used in their fleet for many years and has not had a refurb I would say in about 10+ years - I suppose this is why the flight was so cheap. The staff on board were friendly and efficient. The seat pitch is large so I could sit for 9+ hours comfortably, the seats despite the plane being old, were comfortable and not showing signs of wear.

"Shanghai to Tampa via Heathrow/Gatwick. We received deplorable customer service recently from British Airways. I purchased business class tickets on 11/28/2016 for flights on September 30, 2017. I purchased two tickets for a total of $9,676.26 plus an additional $652 for seat assignments. The problems occurred on our return flights. We were booked October 17, 2017 on BA168 Shanghai to LHR  London with continuing service, October 18, 2017 from London Gatwick)to Tampa. We were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of Shanghai on October 17, 2017. We checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 11:00 A.M. On the evening of October 16, 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 7:00 A.M. In the morning on October 17, the Captain announced that the Chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock. After these announcements we frantically tried to contact British Airways because we expected that we would miss our 11:00 AM flight. We were unable to do so. We were informed that in order to exit China without a visa, we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country. We were aware of this requirement. We had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. We knew that without a visa of valid flights out, we would be escorted to the local Chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country. For obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. We were able to contact a travel agent via e-mail (our phone was not operating as we were at sea in Chin ). Our agent was able to contact British Airways and explain our situation. There was another flight that departed on October 18, which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight. That was Flt BA 160. We were told here are your choices: 1. Pay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights, BA 160 and BA 2167 , even though we would be able to make BA 2167 as it did not depart London (LGW) until 11:55 AM on October 18, 2017. 2. Pay an additional $6,388 per person for a total of $12,776 to keep our business class status on both flights. (We had already paid $10,328.26 for these tickets). 3. Disembark the ship and take our chances with Chinese immigration. Option 2 was outrageous, Option 3 frightening. We felt we had no choice but to choose Option 1. The travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. When we checked in at PVG we asked if there were business class seats available. “Yes, several” was the response. We explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. “Yes, for a cost of $12,776 “. Of course we refused to pay that amount. We were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. While on board during that flight BA160, I went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. When we arrived in London we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats. Were we on the same flight as originally scheduled, but I was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers. Apparently British Airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense.",0.033,0.957,0.01,-0.8106,negative,0.00923202614379085,0.4140522875816993,neutral,0.01394579280167818,0.06626193970441818,0.0015597469173371792,0.10601486265659332,0.8099095225334167,0.0023081470280885696,fear,negative

"Short trip to Vienna in BA Economy Class from Terminal 3. New A320 cabin on the flight out - looks nice and fairly comfortable for a couple of hours. Other than the cheap, highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline. Staff service minimal - they served breakfast and collected the leftovers, basically in the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour and 10 minute flight - not even an additional beverage service. I'm sure if they were flogging the drinks it would be different. Return a couple of days later, older aircraft but clean. Same indifferent service, similar processed carbs handed out in silence and 1 drink.

I am one of those crazy people who still (until recently) flew Edinburgh - London Heathrow weekly paying nearly £400 with British Airways as it's the key airport. Now the last flight always comes to a remote stand and the morning flight (boarding 6.15 for 6.50 flight) is onto a bus to a plane that is never ready and always departs late. Holidays in Madeira ended with me and mum sitting on the floor in a departure hall for 5.5hrs. I wrote to BA and got the big fob off. Add insult to injury and no food at all on the plane!

"Montreal to Rome via London with British Airways. Boarded the plane on time (20.30hrs) and sat for six hours on the tarmac while BA tried to clear a glitch in the landing gear system. They finally gave up and cancelled the flight. I had to get to Rome to catch a cruise ship that was departing at 8pm on Tuesday evening, and here I am in Montreal at 1pm Monday, Rome time. British Airways ticket agent refused to help me change my itinerary (""Go to the hotel on the bus and at 2pm today - local time - we will have new itineraries for everyone.""). I tried to explain the urgency to my situation but she cut me off, ""I can't help you, if I help you now I have to help everyone."" When I pressed her further she gave me the BA 800 number, which was closed due to the late hour. Finally I called British Airways Reservations in London, who re-routed me, on American Airlines. The final kick: I put in a claim for a wasted night's guaranteed stay in Rome, and for cancellation compensation. A month later, British Airways advised me that my claim was approved and I would receive payment in two weeks. Since then, nothing for the last 6 weeks.

LHR-PEK-LHR. We travel BA club world often and my overall impression is very good. Yes sometimes the attitude of the staff can be not up to expectations or the food not comparable with some of the Asian airlines but the price you pay for a business class seat with BA is unbeatable. And for me a flat bed on an overnight flight is what matters the most. Contrary to general recommendations when I travel with a companion I prefer the middle seats on the main deck and not the upper deck because by using the screen you can have your own little intimate cabin.

"This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I wanted to pamper myself, so I bought business class. I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours.

When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only.

If they had told me they were overbooked when I tried to check in online, I could have rerouted via New York and still arrived in time for an important meeting. As it was, I arrived 7 hours late and missed my meeting. British Airways only cares about maximising its profits. It cares nothing for its passengers. I have been a loyal customer of BA for over 50 years. For many years I was a gold card holder and this is how they treat me. They sold me a product and then sold the same product to someone else after I had paid the full and non refundable fare.

"London to Nashville. The worst airline Trans-Atlantic. Despite looking forward to flying on this new route to Nashville, British Airways ruined this trip. The flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound Boeing 787-9 from San Jose. The airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. The WIFI was out of service. On late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothes. On my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology. I am now forced to haggle with British Airways, and endure their woeful so-called Customer Relations department. It is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier. British Airways treat their premium class customers with contempt. This is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from Heathrow.

"My first long haul flight with British Airways for some years and what a mistake! I flew Premium Economy expecting it to be on par with its competitors especially Lufthansa or Virgin Atlantic - not so at all. At the airport, it took over 1 hour to check-in; there was no dedicated premium economy check in nor a premium economy boarding queue at the gate either; perhaps the plane would be a little special? No, not at all, it was an old Boeing 777 that had been designed to maximise seats at the expense of comfort; the cramped space of the premium economy cabin with its 2-4-2 seating was comparable to economy and was light years behind the modern and spaciousness of other airlines, and sitting in a middle row seat meant you could not physically squeeze past the person next to you to the aisle unless you woke the person up or you took your chance to stand over them and hope you manoeuvred successfully. Stupidly I had thought that competition would eliminate most differences between airlines. How wrong I was - avoid British Airways on the Hong Kong route if you are flying on a Boeing 777.

"London Heathrow to Krakow. I am a one world emerald member on AA so I get certain perks when flying British Airways such as free seat selection, lounge use and priority boarding - that makes this airline bearable - just. They are obsessed with carry on bags much like Ryanair giving out silly yellow tags for carry on bags and checking carry on sizes - not sure what it does for them as it only increases their bag handling costs. Their seats are no better than anyone else and their pitch just as tight. What used to set BA apart was their inflight service - even in coach a sandwich or something - this has degraded to nothing, zero - even a soft drink is charged. So I asked for water, I was offered an Evian for $5 - no thanks just plain water. Ok sir we will come back to you after we serve everyone else. Of course he never came back - 2.5 hour flight and not even allowed a cup of water.

"Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refused. Even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused. It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before.

Our flight from London to Boston was okay. Disappointed to only be able to sit in middle of row of 10. Annoying to have to pay extra to have a window seat. Also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful. The return flight was different. Staff not particularly helpful. Person in front reclined seat fully and I wasn't able to fit food tray in. Crew member said I was causing problems for the man in front when I requested he put his seat up to eat. Also armrests did not lift up leaving less than 6 inches between seat in front and armrest meaning I was literally trapped in my seat for 6 hours. Not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency. We had one drinks trolley followed by a meal around an hour later. Staff then disappeared and only water or juice available for rest of flight. Will not use BA again.

I flew club world from JHB to LHR on 21/01 on the 747. The flight experience overall was a good one. Sitting on the upper deck of 747 is definitely a must as its a fair bit quieter than the main deck. The check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk were very friendly especially considering I was travelling with loads of luggage bicycle etc. I didn't use the lounge as I know the one in JNB is not very good. The boarding took place on time and we were offered pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. Take off was a bit delayed but smooth non the less. The food leaves a lot to be desired on BA I had the Salmon main course which was very bland. The up side the champagne was perfectly chilled and the desert was yummy. The seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour. The seat in the lounging position is very comfy but is a bit narrow for sleeping it's also a bit short for taller individuals such as myself. Arrival at T5 was very smooth as I used the fast track lane from landing to climbing in the taxi was less than 30 min. I would definitely fly BA again but they do need to look into the quality of food and the seat configurations for future upgrades.,0.031,0.864,0.106,0.96,positive,0.22173344017094013,0.47860576923076925,positive,0.0004329417715780437,0.9967001080513,0.0017179847927764058,0.000740797258913517,0.0002182749449275434,0.0001898118935059756,joy,positive

LIS-LHR-VIE on Dec. 8 both legs on an Airbus 320 in Club Europe (Business Class) - both legs on time seats were Economy seats with the middle seat left unsold and featuring the new slim seats which are less comfortable and have a reduced seat pitch – Check-in in LIS was handled by rather surly agents which was untypical for an otherwise friendly airport but Business class waiting lines were very short so overall it was OK. LIS-LHR leg was with a rather lacklustre and inattentive European fleet crew after the initial service of food and drinks further service consisted of clearing the dishes and on board sales. Other than that Business class flight attendants were behind the curtain reading magazines chatting and rather attending to themselves than the passengers. At 11 am the Business Class food served was a plate cold cuts a roll and three thin slices of fruit (basically a make yourself sandwich on a plate). Extremely disappointing and poor for a lunch flight scheduled to arrive in Heathrow after 1 pm. On the LHR-VIE leg service was“afternoon tea”meaning again sandwiches. However this time at least it was more appropriate due to time of day. Full bar service on both flights and the French white wine served was ok. The mixed fleet crew on the second leg was more interested in its job and up to BA standards regarding friendliness and attentiveness. Transfer procedures in LHR Terminal 3 were fast and friendly even the extra security checks required for all transfers at LHR (even Intra-EU) were hassle free and easy. BA’s Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 was again an oasis of rest amid a busy airport; comfortable with excellent drink selection and decent food selection including several good warm choices such as various curries. In Lisbon Portela BA uses the shared Blue Lounge which is small and offerings are rather limited; some limited snacks ok drinks but at least good Nespresso coffee. Although small it was not crowded which is a plus. So BA delivered a good basic product for economy standards but I fail to see any real Business Class service offered here (not seat wise not meal wise not service wise). The only saving grace was the Galleries Lounge in Heathrow T3 and the better service on the LHR-VIE leg. Not recommended for Business Class within Europe based on this experience.

"I was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives. Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant. The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you.

On a recent vacation from Sacramento to Paris some friends and I had a terrible experience with another airline and had some trepidation about our return flight from Paris to Sacramento. We did however choose British Airways for the return flight and none of us had flown with them before. I am happy to report that the experience was totally different. Our flight was delayed by an hour which did effect our layover and did rush us to our next flight but we had a cushion of 2 hours layover so we were ok. On the flight the seats were more comfortable more leg room less noisy better entertainment due to screens on seats in front of you and the access to the bathroom was much easier to navigate. We also had seats relatively together which the other airline refused to offer us even though we had made the reservation months in advance. Their screen was so far ahead I couldn't see it and it offered only one choice. The staff was very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable.

"I booked my flights to the UK in May 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the UK on March 12, 2020 .. 4 days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on March 16, 2020 and because I am older and have pre-existing health conditions, my doctor asked me to postpone our trip. The British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable. Now the problem is, I need to rebook and use the travel credit by May 2020 for travel to the UK by May 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip. How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy.

"London Heathrow to Mumbai. I've been a loyal BA customer for several years, but this was a journey of disappointment. I was late to the airport due to delays on the train line. Called customer services while on my way, and after 15min of wait I was told they couldn't do anything about it, but gave me the number of the airport. It was incorrect. At Terminal 5 I asked the attendant for help given the rush. He was quite rude and said I had to join the queue unless I was flying business. At the gate, we had a late boarding because 'the computer wasn't working'. I was flying premium economy and let me say, on this flight (BA0199) it is like the economy class of several other airlines.  Plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment.

The flight attendant (who I never saw smiling for the entire flight) said he had reported it on the way in. I asked to change my seat. In my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops (it wasn't the headphones, I tried mine too). The entertainment system was poor. It started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing, plus the 'noise cancelling' headphones are NOT noise cancelling - try pulling the jack out and it doesn't make a difference. Overall a very poor experience, crowned by a terrible breakfast. Sorry BA but you are stuck in the 80s and you're slipping further down my list of preferences.

"No, no, no, British Airways. You've messed up. Someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said ""Let's provide food from M&S: that will make our offering classier than the rest."" The problem on my 18:55 flight from Marrakech to London was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink, so the service was inevitably snail-paced. A piece of friendly advice, BA, you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight, or you merely annoy your customers. Sitting near the back of the plane, my wife and I got served 2 hours into the 3.5 hour flight, by which time our tongues were hanging out. But what's this? Only two sandwiches left, and we bagged the last two packets of crisps. You're promising things you can't deliver, BA. There is such as thing as advertising standards, and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards. The 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively, even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someone's payment card failed to register on their machine. (Hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) Meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). Other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and M&S extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. Whoever at British Airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. The process I call 'Ryanisation' of British Airways is almost complete. You now charge for checked baggage (yes, I know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even BA used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. Oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin crew deploy the A320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? Too costly, perhaps? I suggest that BA needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but with a minor revision: ""British Airways, the world's least favourite airline"".",0.064,0.846,0.09,0.9511,positive,0.07498236331569666,0.4488536155202823,positive,0.015668053179979324,0.6841691136360168,0.0033472790382802486,0.2852436304092407,0.009317995980381966,0.002253915648907423,joy,positive

"London to Los Angeles. Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. We only took this trip to use up some Avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from LAX on Virgin Atlantic.

"London to Kuala Lumpur. This is my first time flying with BA to Kuala Lumpur on the Dreamliner 787. Was very excited for this trip as BA has made a come back to fly to Malaysia after stopping the service for many years. I paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room. I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time.

"We are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the UK and have had all 4 flights with British Airways. Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.  Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. There was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I was told it was overweight as I was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg.

"When I tried to check in online, I was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £300. I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better.

A little annoying as on the way out all First luggage was the very last off the carousel. Boarding was via gate 2 and then through World Traveller Plus section. Again annoying as that happened with boarding and disembarking on the way out. Electrical problems with entertainment and lighting - resolved after two hours. No First amenity bags on board. No sleep suit offered as not on board either. Seat for buddy dining kept collapsing. As it was the 1st of the month new wine list available. After one glass of Mersault there was no more on board.

"Will never touch British Airways again. Having flown BA on this route from Orlando to London Heathrow for a long time their services have seriosuly gone downhill. When I went to the back of the plane to ask for a snack I was told I had to buy them. Having paid over £1000 for my tickets I replied I'm not doing that I've paid enough for this flight already.
